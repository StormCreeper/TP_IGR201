# IGR201 - TP
*By Telo PHILIPPE, following the IGR201 course at Telecom Paris*

with different tools and a simple GUI in QT and C++.
## Implemented
> Drawing mode
- Drawing free hand, lines, rectangles and ovals
- Unlimited number of shapes
- Can choose color, pen size
> Select mode
- Ability to modifie attributes, and to delete a shape
- Shapes can be resized using handles
- Cursor changes when selecting, drawing, etc
> Other
- Icons for tools
- Save / Load an image file in a custom format
## Todo
- Add style selection (dotted etc)
- Immplement a proper Handle class, to support custom actions (brush tool for example)
- Implement a proper toolbar (menus are slow to use)

- Ability to edit a stroke shape
## Bugs
