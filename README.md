# IGR201 - TP
This is my work for the class IGR201. It is a simple drawing program,
with different tools and a simple GUI in QT and C++.
## Implemented
> Drawing mode
- Drawing free hand, lines, rectangles and ovals
- Unlimited number of shapes
- Can choose color, pen size
> Select mode
- Ability to modifie attributes, and to delete a shape
- Resize using handles
> Other
- Icons for tools
- Save / Load an image file in a custom format
## Todo
- Add style selection (dotted etc)
- Immplement a proper Handle class, to support custom actions (brush tool for example)
- Implement a proper tool bar (menus are slow to use)
- Change cursor when selecting, drawing, etc
## Bugs
